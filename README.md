**Statistics For Data Science**
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode are used to summarize a set of data by identifying the central point.
   - Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, and standard deviation indicate the spread of data points in a dataset.
   - Distribution Shapes: Understanding skewness and kurtosis helps in identifying the asymmetry and the peakedness of the data distribution.
2. **Probablity Theory:**
   - Basic Concepts: Probability, events, sample space, and the rules of probability (addition and multiplication rules).
   - Probability Distributions: Binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions are key in understanding the likelihood of different outcomes.
   
3. **Inferential Statistics:**
   - Null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, and types of errors (Type I and Type II errors) are crucial for making decisions based on data.
   - Confidence Intervals: Estimating the range within which a population parameter lies with a certain level of confidence.
   - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used to compare means among three or more groups to understand if at least one group mean is different from the others
4. **Bayesian Statistics:**
   - Bayes' Theorem: A way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.
   - Prior and Posterior Distributions: Updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.
