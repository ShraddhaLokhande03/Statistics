**Essential Statistics For Data Science**
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode are used to summarize a set of data by identifying the central point.
   - Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, and standard deviation indicate the spread of data points in a dataset.
   - Distribution Shapes: Understanding skewness and kurtosis helps in identifying the asymmetry and the peakedness of the data distribution.
2. **Probability Theory:**
   -Basic Concepts: Probability, events, sample space, and the rules of probability (addition and multiplication rules).
   -Probability Distributions: Binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions are key in understanding the likelihood of different outcomes.
